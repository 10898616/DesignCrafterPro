Here’s a more detailed version of the UI design outline for the desktop application, which allows designers to visualize furniture designs in rooms:

1. Login Screen for Designers
Components:
Input Fields:

Username: Text input field for the designer's username (email or username).

Password: Secure text input field for the designer's password.

Validation: Real-time validation for both username and password fields (e.g., showing "Required" or "Invalid credentials" error message).

Buttons:

Login Button: Submits the login form. When clicked, the system authenticates the designer. The button will be disabled until both fields are filled.

Forgot Password: A link under the password field, which allows the designer to reset the password.

Visual Elements:

Logo: A logo or brand name at the top center of the login screen.

Welcome Text: Brief welcome message like “Welcome Back! Please log in to start designing.”

Background: Subtle gradient or light image reflecting the design theme.

Feedback:

Error Message: If login fails, display a red message below the password field saying "Invalid username or password." The error should be dynamically updated.

Responsive Design: Ensure the screen resizes well for different desktop screen sizes, maintaining usability.

Color Scheme:
Primary Colors: Soft pastel or neutral tones like light gray and white for background, with accent colors such as navy blue or forest green for the buttons and text.

Error Message: Red color for error feedback (e.g., invalid credentials).
